This project will serve as a client server based social network working in a LAN.
Functionalitites-
  -login/register
  -post to global timeline
  -person to person chat
  -lookup timeline
  -pokes
  
We are not going to implement this via socket library;
  handle multiple clients via threads;
  handle databases via sqllite and storing data locally;
  working in Python v2.7
  
Hope that this helps you in some ways, apart from the direct functionality we program :D
To get a step by step idea of the developing flow, refer to the issues of this repo.
